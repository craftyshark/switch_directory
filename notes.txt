okay so, next up we want to be able to click a button and have it sort all the cars by brand 
which means we will need to LIST all the cars by brand. 

we will only really need do that within the javascript. There's no good reason to do it within 
php

so step 1: 

display all the cars in one large batch. 

step 2:
if SwitchBody.tbody != NUll 

then SwitchBody.tbody = NULL 

step 3: 

pull the switches but sorted from the sql 
send over that array after encoding in JSON
